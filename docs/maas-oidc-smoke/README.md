# MaaS OIDC smoke test

This directory contains a browserless smoke test for the MaaS external-OIDC
flow through the single-broker `saas` realm.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the cluster through `kubectl`.
- `kubectl`, `curl`, `jq`, `sed`, and `awk` installed locally.
- A MaaS subscription that is synchronized and healthy.
- A test user provisioned by the Keycloak setup (`alice`, `bob`, or `carol`).
- Access to the Keycloak Secret containing the redirect URI registered for the
  `tenant-demo` OIDC client.

## Run

The script reads the registered OIDC redirect URI from the Keycloak Secret.
Override it only when using a different registered URI:

```sh
REDIRECT_URI='<registered-redirect-uri>' \
  docs/maas-oidc-smoke/scripts/maas-oidc-smoke.sh alice
```

Run the smoke test for a tenant administrator:

```sh
docs/maas-oidc-smoke/scripts/maas-oidc-smoke.sh carol
```

Discover the MaaS Gateway through another Kubernetes context by setting
`GATEWAY_KUBE_CONTEXT`. Keycloak values are still read from the current
context:

```sh
GATEWAY_KUBE_CONTEXT='<context-name>' \
  docs/maas-oidc-smoke/scripts/maas-oidc-smoke.sh alice
```

Run it for the user-subject authorization policy:

```sh
docs/maas-oidc-smoke/scripts/maas-oidc-smoke.sh bob
```

By default, the script discovers the Keycloak issuer from the
`keycloak-public-url` ConfigMap and the MaaS Gateway hostname from the
`maas-default-gateway` Gateway status. Set `GATEWAY_HOST` only when using an
explicit hostname. The host must be a hostname, not a complete URL.

The inference prompt, token limit, and other cluster resource names and
namespaces can be overridden with the
environment variables listed by the script's usage output:

```sh
docs/maas-oidc-smoke/scripts/maas-oidc-smoke.sh --help
```

## What the test verifies

The script:

1. Discovers the Keycloak and MaaS Gateway endpoints from cluster resources.
2. Authenticates the selected user through the configured identity broker.
3. Exchanges the authorization code for an OIDC access token.
4. Calls `/v1/me` and `/v1/subscriptions`.
5. Creates a one-hour ephemeral API key when the user has a subscription.
6. Calls `/v1/api-keys/search` and verifies that a newly created key is listed.
7. Asks for approval, then sends an OpenAI-compatible completion request.

For `alice`, `bob`, and `carol`, the test expects one accessible subscription,
creates an ephemeral API key, and verifies that the key appears in the search
result. It then uses that key for one inference request.

## Inference approval

Before sending the inference request, the script stops and describes the
action: the endpoint, model, prompt, and use of the newly created ephemeral
API key. The request is sent only after an interactive `y` or `yes`
response.

For an unattended run where an explicit approval has already been given outside
the script, set:

```sh
export ASSUME_YES=1
```

## Runtime files

Successful runs write private runtime credentials under `/tmp`:

- `/tmp/maas-alice-access-token`
- `/tmp/maas-bob-access-token`
- `/tmp/maas-carol-access-token`
- `/tmp/maas-alice-api-key`
- `/tmp/maas-bob-api-key`
- `/tmp/maas-carol-api-key`

Remove these files when they are no longer needed. API keys created by the
script expire after one hour.

## GitOps and secret safety

The script does not change Kubernetes desired state and does not commit
cluster endpoints, API URLs, kubeconfig contexts, client secrets, user
passwords, tokens, or API keys. It only reads Kubernetes resources and invokes
the MaaS APIs. The ephemeral API key is runtime application data, not GitOps
configuration.
